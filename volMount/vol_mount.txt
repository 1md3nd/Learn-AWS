MOUNT a volume

1. Instance 'xyz' in zone 'a'
2. Volumne  'abc' in zone 'a'

3. Attach the volume to instance xyz

4. lsblk - to check all the attached volumes
	- xvda -> root volumes
	- xvdf -> first attached volume
	- xvdg -> second attached volume

5. Format the volume (for newly created volume)
	- sudo mkfs -t ext3 /dev/xvdf

6. Create a mount point inside root
	- sudo mkdir /newvol

7. Temp. mount the volume 'abc' to /newvol
	- sudo mount /dev/xvdf /newvol

DONE Temoprary mount
	
8 . Permanent mount 
	- /etc/fstab --> Your Linux system's filesystem table, aka fstab , is a configuration table designed to ease the burden of mounting and unmounting file systems to a machine. It is a set of rules used to control how different filesystems are treated each time they are introduced to a system. Consider USB drives, for example.
	
 	- nano /etc/fstab -> open the extec file for mount devices
 	- EDIT & add a row
 	- /dev/xvdf /newvol ext3 defaults,nofail 0 0

DONE PERMANENT MOUNT

## Table structure

- /dev/xvdf /newvol ext3 defaults,nofail 0 0

The table itself is a 6 column structure, where each column designates a specific parameter and must be set up in the correct order. The columns of the table are as follows from left to right: 

- Device: usually the given name or UUID of the mounted device (sda1/sda2/etc).
- Mount Point: designates the directory where the device is/will be mounted. 
- File System Type: nothing trick here, shows the type of filesystem in use. 
- Options: lists any active mount options. If using multiple options they must be separated by commas. 
- Backup Operation: (the first digit) this is a binary system where 1 = dump utility backup of a partition. 0 = no backup. This is an outdated backup method and should NOT be used. 
- File System Check Order: (second digit) Here we can see three possible outcomes.  0 means that fsck will not check the filesystem. Numbers higher than this represent the check order. The root filesystem should be set to 1 and other partitions set to 2.
