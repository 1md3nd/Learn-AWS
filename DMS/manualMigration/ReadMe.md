# Manual Migration

Here we are going to migrate from MySQL to Aurora MySQL manually.

## MySQL

Here we can see the schema of both the tables.

## Dumping the Database

![Dumping Database](../img-ref/image-1.png)

While doing `mysqldump` for our test database, if you are using Global Transaction Identifiers (GTIDs) with InnoDB (GTIDs arenâ€™t available with MyISAM), you will want to use the `--set-gtid-purged=OFF` option.

Then you would issue this command:
```
mysqldump --all-databases --single-transaction --set-gtid-purged=OFF --user=root --password > all_databases.sql
```
Otherwise, you will see this error:
```
Warning: A partial dump from a server that has GTIDs will by default include the GTIDs of all transactions, even those that changed suppressed parts of the database. If you don't want to restore GTIDs, pass --set-gtid-purged=OFF. To make a complete dump, pass --all-databases --triggers --routines --events.
```
You can also execute a partial backup of all of your databases. This example will be a partial backup because I am not going to backup the default databases for MySQL (which are created during installation): `mysql`, `test`, `PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA`, and `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`.

Note: `mysqldump` does not dump the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` database by default. To dump `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`, name it explicitly on the command line and also use the `--skip-lock-tables` option.

`mysqldump` never dumps the `performance_schema` database. It also does not dump the MySQL Cluster `ndbinfo` information database.

## Dumping from MySQL
It is not recommended to load a dump file when GTIDs are enabled on the server (`gtid_mode=ON`), if your dump file includes system tables. `mysqldump` issues DML instructions for the system tables which use the non-transactional MyISAM storage engine, and this combination is not permitted when GTIDs are enabled.

![Dumping from MySQL](../img-ref/sqldump.png)
```
mysqldump -h test-dms-mysql.cd3frml2rsf5.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com -u admin -p --databases test --single-transaction --set-gtid-purged=OFF > all_databases.sql
```

## Loading into Aurora MySQL

Login into Aurora MySQL.

![Login into Aurora MySQL](../img-ref/load-aurora.png)

### Now we load the .sql file to our Aurora MySQL 
```
mysql -h test-dms-aurora-mysql-instance-1.cd3frml2rsf5.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com -u admin -p < all_databases.sql 
```

After loading the data, we can clearly see that the databases and tables are being created.

## Verify Schema

![MySQL Tables Schema](../img-ref/mysql_table_schema.png) | ![Aurora MySQL Tables Schema](../img-ref/aurora_tables_schema.png)
:--: | :--:
MySQL Tables Schema | Aurora MySQL Tables Schema

Now we can also see that the schema of the tables in Aurora MySQL matches the schema of the MySQL earlier.

## Problems

During manual migration, several potential issues may arise:

1. **Data Consistency**: Ensuring data consistency is very important; there should not be any data loss during migration.

2. **Migration Downtime**: Based on the size of the database, the downtime can be significant.

3. **Data Transfer Limitation**: Since the manual migration works by dumping the data, in the case of a larger database, the time and memory requirements can be substantial. Use suitable solutions to address these issues.
